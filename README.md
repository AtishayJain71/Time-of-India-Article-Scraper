## ðŸ§© How It Works

1. **Input:** A list of Times of India article URLs.
2. **Scraping:** For each URL, the scraper:
   - Extracts the article title from the `<h1>` tag.
   - Finds the publication date inside a `<div>` with class `_3Mkg- byline`.
   - Collects the main article content from `<div>` elements with class `_s30J clearfix`.
3. **Preprocessing:** Cleans the text by removing extra spaces and unwanted characters.
4. **Output:** Saves the collected data into a CSV file with columns:  
   `head` (headline), `text` (article body), `date` (publication date).
